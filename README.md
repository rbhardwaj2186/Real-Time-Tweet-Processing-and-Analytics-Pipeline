This project simulates a real-time data pipeline for ingesting, processing, and analyzing tweets using Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Elasticsearch, and Kibana. The goal is to demonstrate how a data engineering pipeline can be used to process real-time tweet streams for analytics and visualization.

The system integrates key technologies to build an end-to-end solution that ingests tweet data, processes it in real-time, stores it in Elasticsearch for fast retrieval, and visualizes key insights using Kibana.
Key Features

    Real-Time Data Ingestion: Simulate live tweets using Kafka Producer, sending messages to Kafka topics.
    Stream Processing: Use Apache Flink for filtering, transforming, and processing tweet data in real-time.
    Data Storage: Store processed tweets in Elasticsearch for efficient search and analytics.
    Data Visualization: Use Kibana dashboards to visualize tweet trends, popular hashtags, geographic distributions, and more.
    Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets and continuous streams of data with minimal latency.

Technologies Used

    Apache Kafka: For real-time data ingestion and message streaming.
    Apache Flink: For stream processing and real-time analytics on the tweet data.
    Elasticsearch: To index, store, and query the processed tweet data.
    Kibana: For visualizing tweet insights and building custom dashboards.
    Python: Kafka producer/consumer logic and custom ETL processes.
    Kanban: Agile project management using a Kanban board.

System Architecture

    Kafka Producer:
        Simulates real-time tweet ingestion by reading data from a local JSON file (data.json) and sending tweets to a Kafka topic (my-topic-test).

    Kafka Consumer:
        Consumes the tweet messages from the Kafka topic and processes them (printing in the console or forwarding to Flink for real-time stream processing).

    Apache Flink:
        Consumes the data from the Kafka topic, performs transformations (filtering, aggregations, etc.), and forwards the processed data to Elasticsearch.

    Elasticsearch:
        Stores processed tweet data for fast search and analytics.

    Kibana:
        Visualizes the processed data using custom dashboards, showcasing trends, hashtags, geographic data, etc.

Project Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

    Apache Kafka installed locally or accessible on a server.
    Apache Flink installed locally.
    Elasticsearch and Kibana installed and running.
    Python 3.x environment.

Installation Steps

    Clone the Repository

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kafka-tweet-processing-pipeline.git
cd kafka-tweet-processing-pipeline

Install Required Python Libraries

bash

pip install kafka-python rich elasticsearch

Set Up Kafka

    Start Zookeeper (if Kafka is installed locally):

    bash

zookeeper-server-start.sh /path/to/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties

Start Kafka server:

bash

kafka-server-start.sh /path/to/kafka/config/server.properties

Create a Kafka topic (my-topic-test):

bash

    kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic-test --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1

Run the Producer

    The producer reads tweets from data.json and sends them to the Kafka topic:

    bash

    python kafka_tweets_producer.py

Run the Consumer

    The consumer reads from the Kafka topic and prints the tweets:

    bash

    python kafka_tweets_consumer.py

Start Flink

    Ensure Flink is running and configured to consume data from Kafka and send it to Elasticsearch.

Elasticsearch and Kibana Setup

    Make sure Elasticsearch is running:

    bash

        ./elasticsearch

        Open Kibana to visualize the data by creating dashboards based on the indexed tweets.

Project Components
1. kafka_tweets_producer.py

Simulates real-time tweet ingestion by reading from data.json and sending the data to Kafka. The producer continuously sends the tweets to the topic my-topic-test.
2. kafka_tweets_consumer.py

Consumes tweets from the Kafka topic and processes them (prints the output). The consumer subscribes to the my-topic-test topic and processes each message in real-time.
3. tweets_datastream_simulator.py

Simulates reading tweets from a JSON file (data.json), simulating real-time streaming data.
4. Flink Stream Processing

Real-time tweet processing with Flink, performing operations such as filtering tweets by hashtags, analyzing tweet trends, or calculating user engagement metrics (retweets, favorites).
5. Elasticsearch and Kibana

Stores processed tweets and provides a rich set of tools for querying and visualizing the tweet data. You can create custom Kibana dashboards to explore tweet data in real-time.
Kibana Visualization

Kibana allows the visualization of processed tweet data stored in Elasticsearch. Example dashboards include:

    Top Hashtags: A bar chart showing the most used hashtags in the tweet stream.
    User Engagement: Line graphs showing tweet engagement over time (retweets, likes).
    Geographic Distribution: A map showing where tweets are coming from based on location data.

Future Improvements

    Add more advanced processing in Flink (sentiment analysis, topic modeling).
    Incorporate additional data sources (Twitter API, web scraping).
    Scale the pipeline to process larger volumes of data and handle more Kafka partitions.
